# Linear Regression Analysis - R Project
This project was developed as part of the "Introduction to Data Science" course at University of Jeddah.
We used R language to analyze the relationship between temprature and ozone levels using the 'airquality' dataset.

## Features:
- Data cleaning (hansling missing values, duplicates)
- Correlation analysis
- Linear regression modeling
- Evaluation using R-squard and RMSE
- Visualization with histogram and boxplot

## Tools & Technolofies:
- R Language
- RStudio
- Data cleaning
- Linear Regression
- Visualization

#Team Members:
- Rimas Almuntashiri
- Sadeem Awak
- Mariam Bourima

----------------------------------------------
- This project demonstrates our understanding of linear regression in R and how to analyze environmental data through real datasets.
